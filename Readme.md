# Aco Templates

These are templates made from 1PH templates used by 1st Para-Hussars. These templates are my spin on the base template. 
As time goes by more templates will show up for various terrains and situations.

Current difference from 1PH base template: (Updated on 4/18/2022)

1. Arsenal creation moved to a script for smaller mission file size, and to have the same arsenal without editing them manually.
2. Removed some extra clutter items from base. Added more Arsenal points to avoid crowding
3. Vehicle repair area script updated to show progress in chat, and incrementally fix things.
4. ACE self interaction 1PH scripts all gathered together to declutter the menu.
5. Changed Default loadout of units to make sure they have almost everything they need for the mission before it starts. Of course they can customize in the arsenal after the initial spawn.
6. Fixed static weapon spawn.
