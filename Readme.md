Current difference from 1PH base template: (Updated on 4/18/2022)

1. Arsenal creation moved to a script for smaller mission file size, and to have the same arsenal without editing them manually.
2. Removed some extra clutter items from base. Added more Arsenal points to avoid crowding
3. Vehicle repair area script updated to show progress in chat, and incrementally fix things.
4. ACE self interaction 1PH scripts all gathered together to declutter the menu.
5. Changed Default loadout of units to make sure they have almost everything they need for the mission before it starts. Of course they can customize in the arsenal after the initial spawn.
6. Fixed static weapon spawn.
7. All the medics have their own medical stations.
