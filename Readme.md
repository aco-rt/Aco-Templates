# Aco Templates

These are templates made from 1PH templates used by 1st Para-Hussars. These templates are my spin on the base template. 
As time goes by more templates will show up for various terrains and situations.

Current difference from 1PH base template:

1. Arsenal items refined
    - 40mm vanilla smoke rounds replace the PR, SOG (vietnam) ones, removed a few duplicates.
    - Added Ammo for GM6 lynx in the arsenal
    - Added probe box ammo for the taser.
2. Removed some extra clutter items from base.
3. Vehicle repair area script updated to show progress in chat, and incrementally fix things.
4. ACE self interaction 1PH scripts all gathered together to declutter the menu.
